In the [standard library][lib] of Arend, a number of [language extensions][ext] (or _metas_ by another name) are implemented.
Those extensions are great but lacks detailed description on their behaviors in the documentation
provided in the source code.
This section serves as a place for detailed and example-driven documentation for the metas
implemented in the standard library.

These metas are scattered into several modules:

+ [Meta](/documentation/standard-tactics/meta)
+ [Paths.Meta](/documentation/standard-tactics/path-meta)
+ [Function.Meta](/documentation/standard-tactics/function-meta)
+ [Algebra.Meta](/documentation/standard-tactics/algebra-meta)
+ [Logic.Meta](/documentation/standard-tactics/logic-meta)
+ [Debug.Meta](/documentation/standard-tactics/debug-meta)
