In the [standard library][lib] of Arend, a number of [language extensions][ext] are implemented.
Those extensions are great but lacks detailed description on their behaviors in the documentation
provided in the source code.
This section serves as a place for detailed and example-driven documentation for the extensions
implemented in the standard library.
