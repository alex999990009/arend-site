## Plugin updates

### Proof Search {#proof-search}

Nearly every proof assistant has a problem of the discoverability for proven theorems. For instance, try to recall how a lemma describing the commutativity of addition is called in your favorite proof assistant. Is it `add_comm`? Or `+-comm`?

The new "Proof Search" action helps in this situation. Invoke it and type in a signature of the declaration you are interested in – the IDE will find the declarations with such a signature:

{% include video.html src="/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/proof-search.mp4" %}

For more information, please see the [full documentation](/documentation/proof-search). 

-- TODO make sure link above works

### Tracer {#tracer}

The tracer is a new feature that allows you typechecking a declaration step-by-step. 
At each step, the IDE shows you the typechecking context for the current expression.

{% include video.html src="/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/tracer.mp4" %}

To use the tracer:

1. Start it via a pop-up menu on a declaration or expression.
2. Step through the expressions back and forth, jump to a specific expression via "Run to Cursor", and stop early if needed.
3. Inspect the stack and the context in the editor view at each tracing step.

Compared to the "Show Expression Type" action, the tracer works in more contexts, shows more info, but could be slower.

### Re-worked "Arend Messages" panel {#arend-messages-panel}

The "Arend Messages" panel shows current goals and errors. We did a number of changes that are aimed to improve the UX around it:

- Goals and errors are shown in separate panels.
- Goals' panel is not cleaned up when you remove the goal. It is only removed when a declaration, which contained a goal, has no more errors or other goals.
- Implicit goals (goals without a corresponding `{?}` element in the source code) are not shown by default.
- The vertical layout is supported.

{% include video.html src="/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/arend-messages.mp4" %}

### Live templates {#live-templates}

Live templates are smart code snippets. They speed up editing by providing a completion for common code patterns. 
This release includes such templates for the majority of Arend keywords:

{% include video.html src="/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/live-templates.mp4" %}

In addition, you can define your own templates in "Preferences \| Editor \| Live Templates \| Arend":

![](/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/live-templates-custom.png)

### Optimize imports {#optimize-imports}

Keeping imports clean is easier with this release. The IDE detects unused imports and highlights them in grey color.
To remove such imports use the new "Code \| Optimize Imports" action:

{% include video.html src="/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/optimize-imports.mp4" %}

Aside from just removing, this action can optimize the imports in various ways, for example, import all declarations from a module explicitly.
See "Preferences \| Editor \| Code Style \| Arend" for the options.

### Extract expression to `\let` binding {#extract-let}

If you have a complex expression and want to extract some of its parts into `\let` bindings, 
the new "Create \let-binding" intention is there to automate the process:

{% include video.html src="/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/let.mp4" %}

### Generate function from a goal with arguments {#generate-from-goal}

The "Generate function from a goal" intention is smarter now. When you invoke it on a goal with arguments, 
the resulting function will get parameters corresponding to those arguments:

{% include video.html src="/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/gen-func.mp4" %}
