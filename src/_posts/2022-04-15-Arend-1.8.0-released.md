## Plugin updates

### Proof Search {#proof-search}

Nearly every proof assistant has a problem of the discoverability for proven theorems. For instance, try to recall how a lemma describing the commutativity of addition is called in your favorite proof assistant. Is it `add_comm`? Or `+-comm`?

The new "Proof Search" action helps in this situation. Invoke it and type in a signature of the declaration you are interested in – the IDE will find the declarations with such a signature:

![](/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/???)

For more information, please see the [full documentation](/documentation/proof-search). 

-- TODO make sure link above works

### Tracer {#tracer}

The tracer is a new feature that allows you typechecking a declaration step-by-step. 
At each step, the IDE shows you the typechecking context for the current expression.

![](/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/???)

To use the tracer:

1. Start it via a pop-up menu on a declaration or expression.
2. Step through the expressions back and forth, jump to a specific expression via "Run to Cursor", and stop early if needed.
3. Inspect the stack and the context in the editor view at each tracing step.

### Re-worked "Arend Messages" panel {#arend-messages-panel}

The "Arend Messages" panel shows current goals and errors. We did a number of changes that are aimed to improve the UX around it:

- Goals and errors are shown in separate panels.
- Goals' panel is not cleaned up when you remove the goal. It is only removed when a declaration, which contained a goal, has no more errors or other goals.
- Implicit goals (goals without a corresponding `{?}` element in the source code) are not shown by default.
- The vertical layout is supported.

### Live templates {#live-templates}

Live templates are smart code snippets. They speed up editing by providing a completion for common code patterns. 
This release includes such templates for the majority of Arend keywords:

![](/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/???)

In addition, you can define your own templates in "Preferences | Editor | Live Templates | Arend":

![](/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/???)

### Optimize imports {#optimize-imports}

Keeping imports clean is easier with this release. The IDE detects unused imports and highlights them in grey color.
To remove such imports use the new "Code | Optimize Imports" action:

![](/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/???)

Aside from just removing, this action can optimize the imports in various ways, for example, import all declarations from a module explicitly.
See "Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Arend" for the options.

### Extract expression to `\let` binding {#extract-let}

If you have a complex expression and want to extract some of its parts into `\let` bindings, 
the new "Create \let-binding" intention is there to automate the process:

![](/assets/Arend-1.8.0-released/???)

### Generate function from a goal with arguments {#generate-from-goal}

The "Generate function from a goal" intention is smarter now. When you invoke it on a goal with arguments, 
the resulting function will get parameters corresponding to those arguments:
