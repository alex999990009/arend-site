title:  "Arend 1.3.0 released"
---

We implemented language extensions.
This can be used to implement custom operations on the abstract syntax tree which are not supported by the language.
They can also be used to implement various decision procedures for proof automation.

Language updates:
* Implemented [language extensions](/about/arend-features#language-extensions).
* Arend now shows conditions in goals which makes it easier to write functions over higher inductive types.

Plugin updates:
* Implemented "[show type](/about/intellij-arend/show-types)" feature.
* Implemented "[show (normalized) expression](/about/intellij-features#show-expr)" feature.
  This can be used to see inferred implicit arguments or the result of invocation of some function.
* Implemented "[replace (sub)expression](/about/intellij-features#normalize-expr)" feature.
  This can be used to replace an expression with its normalized result.
